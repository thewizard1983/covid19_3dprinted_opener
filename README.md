# covid19_3dprinted_opener
A 3d printable tool for opening doors, interact with buttons and touchscreens, without touching them.

You can bring it with you in your pocket and use it when it is needed.

The hook form allows for opening and closing any kind of handle, while the small bulge at the top of the hook allow you for operating on buttons like elevetors and ATMs.

With a small modification, you can enable this tool to work also with touchscreens.
You can modify it in three ways:
1. Color the buldfe and continue app to the hole for finger, with conductive ink (you can find it on amazon). This allow for creating a conduction path between you and the bulge, creating the capacitiv armor you need for touchscreens.
2. Wrap the tool with alluminium foil; the tool will become completelly conductive.
3. Print it with conductive filament (usually based on graphite).
